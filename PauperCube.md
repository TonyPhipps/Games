# Rules and How to Play
- Assuming 8 players, each player receives 3 booster packs containing 15 cards.
  - If there are 4 players, each player receives 6 boosters of 15, and each player sets aside the last card of each pack ("burns" the last card).
  - If there are 6 players, each player receives 6 boosters of 15, and each player sets aside the last card of every other pack ("burns" the last card).
- Each player opens one of these booster packs and looks through the 15 cards.
- Players simultaneously choose one card from their booster, and pass the remaining cards face-down to the player to their left.
- Players repeatedly choose a card and pass the rest until there's no cards left in the first round of packs.
- Repeat this process again for booster pack #2 but players now pass remaining cards to the right.
- Repeat this process again for booster pack #3 but players now pass remaining cards to the left.
- With the 45 cards you have "drafted", and adding as many basic lands as you like (Forest, Island etc.), assemble a deck of at least 40 cards, with any remaining cards forming your sideboard.
  - Usually 15-18 creatures, 5-8 non creatures, and ~17 lands.
- Play with the deck you just built! A fun way to play is a tournament where each matchup winner is determined by best 2 of 3 games.

# Shuffling 
Novel Method for Shuffling a Cube
https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/s/oBquUy5x98

#### Step 1
Sort your cube and separate it into sections by color. Make six piles: one for each monocolor and a sixth for everything else.

- White (48 cards)
- Blue (48 cards)
- Black (48 cards)
- Red (48 cards)
- Green (48 cards)
- Multicolor/Hybrid/Colorless/Land (120 cards)

(Henceforth we'll call that last pile the "Everything Else pile".)

#### Step 2
Shuffle each monocolored pile using whatever method you're comfortable with. No need to shuffle the Everything Else pile yet.

Added benefit: I like to sort my cube between drafts anyway, to make sure that nothing is missing.

#### Step 3
From each monocolored pile, move cards to the Everything Else pile until it contains 50% of your total count (about 25% out of each monocolored pile). Each monocolored pile will contain 10% of your total count.

- White (36 cards)
- Blue (36 cards)
- Black (36 cards)
- Red (36 cards)
- Green (36 cards)
- Everything Else (180 cards)

The Everything Else pile now has some cards from every section of the cube. Shuffle the Everything Else pile using whatever method you're comfortable with.

#### Step 4
From the Everything Else pile, distribute cards into each monocolored pile. Once you're done, each monocolored pile should contain 20% of your total count.

- White+ (72)
- Blue+ (72)
- Black+ (72)
- Red+ (72)
- Green+ (72)

The + sign indicates that each pile is now comprised of half its original color and half unknown.

#### Step 5
Shuffle each pile color+ pile.

#### Step 6
Split each color+ pile into n/15 "pack piles" (where n is your total card count). This results in each pack using 3 cards from each pile.

Give each pack a quick shuffle to remove the possibility of a pattern.

#### Summary
Each pack now contains:

- 3 White+
- 3 Blue+
- 3 Black+
- 3 Red+
- 3 Green+

And that's it! Your packs are ready to draft.
