# Rules and How to Play
With 10 Players (see below table for fewer players)
- Each player will receive 3 booster packs containing 15 cards.
- Each player opens one of these booster packs and looks through the 15 cards. This starts a round.
  - Players simultaneously choose one card from their booster and pass the remaining cards face-down to the player to their left.
  - Players repeatedly choose a card and pass the rest until there's no cards left in the first round of packs.
- Repeat this process again for booster pack #2 (Round 2) but players now pass remaining cards to the right.
- Repeat this process again for booster pack #3 (Round 3) but players now pass remaining cards to the left.
- With the 45 cards you have "drafted", and adding as many basic lands as you like (Forest, Island etc.), assemble a deck of at least 40 cards, with any remaining cards forming your sideboard.
  - Usually 15-18 creatures, 5-8 non creatures, and ~17 lands.
- Play with the deck you just built! A fun way to play is a tournament where each matchup winner is determined by best 2 of 3 games.

### Modifications for Fewer Players
For the easiest approach, just draft 3 packs of 15 and lose visibility of some of the cards in the cube.

It's rare to actually get 10 people to play. In order to expose as many cards as possible, I recommend these modifications.

| Cards | Players | Packs/Player | Cards/Pack | Cards Kept | How It Looks in Practice                                 |
| ----- | ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 450   | 10      | 3            | 15         | 45         | Same as in Store                                         |
| 448   | 8       | 4            | 14         | 48         | Randomly remove 2 cards; Burn Last 2 Per Pack            |
| 450   | 6       | 5            | 15         | 50         | Burn Last 5 Cards Per Pack -OR- Pick 1 pass, Pick 1 Burn |
| 448   | 4       | 8            | 14         | 56         | Randomly remove 2 cards; Pick 1 Burn 1                   |

# Shuffling 
Novel Method for Shuffling a Cube
https://www.reddit.com/r/mtgcube/s/oBquUy5x98

NOTE: Card counts below represent 360/450 card cubes.

#### Step 1 - Color Piles
Sort your cube and separate it into sections by color. Make six piles: one for each monocolor and a sixth for everything else.

- White (48/68 cards)
- Blue (48/68 cards)
- Black (48/68 cards)
- Red (48/68 cards)
- Green (48/68 cards)
- Multicolor/Colorless (120/110 cards)

(Henceforth we'll call that last pile the "Everything Else pile".)

#### Step 2 - Shuffle
Shuffle each monocolored pile using whatever method you're comfortable with. No need to shuffle the Everything Else pile yet.

Added benefit: I like to sort my cube between drafts anyway, to make sure that nothing is missing.

#### Step 3 - Color Piles Give 50%
From each monocolored pile, move cards to the Everything Else pile until it contains 50% of your total count (about 25% out of each monocolored pile). Each monocolored pile will contain 10% of your total count.

- White (45 cards)
- Blue (45 cards)
- Black (45 cards)
- Red (45 cards)
- Green (45 cards)
- Everything Else (225 cards)

The Everything Else pile now has some cards from every section of the cube. 

#### Step 4 - Shuffle Everything Else Pile
Shuffle the Everything Else pile.

#### Step 5 - Disperse Everything Else Back into Color Piles
From the Everything Else pile, distribute cards into each monocolored pile. Once you're done, each monocolored pile should contain 20% of your total count.

- White+ (90)
- Blue+ (90)
- Black+ (90)
- Red+ (90)
- Green+ (90)

The + sign indicates that each pile is now comprised of half its original color and half unknown.

#### Step 6 - Shuffle Color Piles
Shuffle each pile color+ pile.

#### Step 7 - Split Color Piles into 15c Packs (3 from each)
Split each color+ pile into n/15 "pack piles" (where n is your total card count). This results in each pack using 3 cards from each pile.

Give each pack a quick shuffle to remove the possibility of a pattern.

#### Summary
Each pack now contains:

- 3 White+
- 3 Blue+
- 3 Black+
- 3 Red+
- 3 Green+

And that's it! Your packs are ready to draft.
