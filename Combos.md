# My Favorite Combos

## Dualcaster Mage

<details> <summary>Explanation</summary>
  
1. Cast a key Instant or Sorcery: This spell creates the foundation for the combo. It often involves creating token copies or manipulating permanents entering the battlefield.
2. Play [[Dualcaster Mage]]: As [[Dualcaster Mage]] enters the battlefield, its triggered ability allows you to copy the spell you just cast.
3. Target the Copy on [[Dualcaster Mage]]: By targeting the copy spell on [[Dualcaster Mage]] itself, you essentially create a loop. The copy resolves, putting another [[Dualcaster Mage]] onto the battlefield.
4. Repeat with the New [[Dualcaster Mage]]: With the new [[Dualcaster Mage]], you can copy the original spell again, targeting the copy on yet another [[Dualcaster Mage]], continuing the loop.

This loop can generate various benefits depending on the combo:

- Infinite Enter the Battlefield (ETB) Triggers: If the original spell involves creatures entering the battlefield, the loop can create infinite creature tokens or trigger ETB abilities numerous times.
- Infinite Mana: Some combos utilize spells that return permanents to the battlefield, allowing you to bounce lands and generate infinite mana.
- Win Condition: Certain combos couple this loop with a win condition like drawing your entire deck or dealing infinite damage.
