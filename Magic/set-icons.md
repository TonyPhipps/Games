# Size
The set symbol typically occupies an area of about 1 square centimeter (≈0.4 square inches). Pixel Size (Approximate): 150 pixels in height/width (depending on the symbol's complexity and aspect ratio).

When designing your SVG, you should focus on making the symbol clean and legible at a very small size. A good practice is to design it much larger (e.g., 500x500 pixels) and ensure all lines and gradients look good when you scale it down to test its legibility at the final required size.

When designing in Inkscape at 500x500px, make sure you uncheck the option to "Scale the stroke width by the same proportion" (found in the tool control bar when the Select tool is active). This ensures your final, desired stroke width is preserved when you export or paste the icon at the much smaller size (like 150x150px for final print).

## Stroke Size
For Common (Black symbol on a light background): The white outline is typically the thinnest, as it needs to simply prevent the black from blending with any surrounding dark card elements. A thickness of 2.5px to 5px should keep it fine and subtle.

For Rare/Mythic/Uncommon (Metallic Fill on a dark background): The black outline is slightly thicker (e.g., 5px to 7.5px) to provide better contrast against the metallic colors and the background of the card's text line.


# Mythic Set Icon
To replicate the Mythic symbol in Inkscape:
- Angle: The angle is often slight, around 0 to 45 degrees (running from bottom-left to top-right, for example).
- Stops: It's often a three-stop gradient (or more) to create the "shine" effect:
  - Stop 1: Dark Red/Orange (e.g., #B43326)
  - Stop 2 (Center): Bright Gold/Yellow (e.g., #F59326)
  - Stop 3: Dark Red/Orange (e.g., #B43326)


# Rare
To replicate the Rare symbol in Inkscape:
- Apply a Linear Gradient fill to your black silhouette icon.
- Set a darker gold (e.g., #887441) for the outer stops.
- Set a bright yellow-gold (e.g., #E9D292) for the central stop.
- Angle the gradient diagonally (or horizontally) so the bright center creates a clean metallic highlight.
- (Optional but Recommended) Add a thin black stroke around the symbol for crispness.


# Uncommon
To replicate the Uncommon symbol in Inkscape:
- Apply a Linear Gradient fill to your black silhouette icon.
- Set a dark, cool grey/blue (e.g., #4B6C79) for the outer stops.
- Set a light, almost white-blue (e.g., #BAE2EF) for the central stop.
- Angle the gradient diagonally or horizontally to create a metallic highlight.
- (Optional but Recommended) Add a thin black stroke around the symbol for clarity.


# Common
To replicate the Common symbol in Inkscape:

- Apply a Solid Color Fill of Black (#000000) to your silhouette icon.
- Set the Stroke Paint to White (#FFFFFF).
- Set the Stroke Style to a very thin width (e.g., 0.5 px).
- Note: The reverse is sometimes true for light-colored symbols from alternative card treatments, where the symbol is white with a black stroke, but solid black is the standard common rarity.
