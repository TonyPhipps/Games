The cards included are intended to be great adds in their respective color. 

Some cards here are great for a mono-white deck, but less so with a white+blue or a white+blue+black.

# Overview
This is the process I use.
- Find a Commander that interests you.
- Check out your selected commander on www.edhrec.com and see what others have come up with on www.moxfield.com. Consider using Scryfall as a source of cards as well. There is a section at the bottom of this document on Scryfall.
- Consider the synergies and win conditions you'd like to take advantage of.
- Start a deck on a website (like Moxfield) and just start adding cards you think will go well with the commander. 
- Add 10-50 creatures, 10-20 Sorceries, 10-20 Instants, 10-20 Artifacts, 10-20 enchantments, 40-50 lands. Plan to trim these lists down.
- Take advantage of how Moxfield displays the cards in your deck.
  - View dropdown - I use Text.
  - Group dropdown - I like to go back and forth viewing Group: "Type" and "Type & Tags"
  - Sort dropdown - I use Name usually, but sometimes Price.
  - Advanced button - I like to enable Include Extra Data > Mana Cost and Price
- Add at least one tag to every card to help categorize the components of the deck. Swap to Group: Type and Tags to help.

Once card are all in a category, trim down the total number of cards by removing the cards that are less synergistic. You will probably bounce back and forth between Grouping by Type and by "Type & Tag" here.
  - Consider the following as you trim down cards. There will be a section below on each.
    - Guiding Questions
    - Card Categories
    - Mana Curve
    - Mana Base
    - Cutting Cards
    - Power Level
    - Saltiness

Play the deck a few times. Develop an idea of what tweaks it needs, then do it.
   

## Guiding Questions
- How will I end the game (win)?
- How will I get the cards to end the game?
- How will I protect the cards that make my strategy work?
- How will I slow prevent others from winning before me?
- How will I power my tutors, draws, and protection?

## Card Categories
It is recommended that you create a tag for each category and use them during deck building, especially to find cards that fit into multiple categories. This lets you ensure you have a good idea of how many cards you have in each area. I recommend you have a non-zero number of all of these.

- **Interaction** (includes single removal, Counterspells)
- **Wipes** (includes board wipes, single-sided wipes, selective wipes)
- **Draw** (Includes Card Advantage)
- **Selection** (Card selection, like Scry or Surveil)
- **Ramp** (Includes Mana Advantage)
- **Graveyard** Hate (anything that exiles one or more cards from graveyards)
- **Protection** (anything that protects your commander or any other key elements)
- **Combat Tricks** (instants or flash cards designed to change the outcome of combat)
- **Synergy** (anything that synergizes with what your deck is trying to do. I usually end up with more than one synergy tag)

**Note** - A card that does two of these should be added to both tags. A card that fits in two or more tags is actually more versatile and therefore better overall.

# Mana Curve
If you were to count up the total mana cost of each card and sort them in to a bar chart from 0 CMC to 7+, the resulting bar chart and curve of the top of each bar is the Mana Curve. Moxfield provides a nice automated Mana Curve under your deck.

This is a decent starting point for any deck until/if you develop a way to effectively alter your curve. Note there are many decks that will alter the curve, sometimes significantly. 

- Zero-mana or one-mana: 5-10
- Two-mana: 14-20
- Three-mana: 10-18
- Four-mana: 6-12
- Five-mana:5-10
- Six-mana: 3-6
- Seven-mana or greater: 1-5

# Mana Base
The mana base describes all the cards in the deck that produce mana, to include lands, artifacts, creatures, etc. This is a pretty big topic in itself.

- I strongly recommend 36 lands, regardless of other mana-producing cards, which you should also have. 
- You should have multiple lands that produce more than one mana type, if in a multicolor deck.
- Use the little feature under your deck on Moxfield that shows percentages of mana pips available on cards versus cards that require that type of mana.
- Keep mana cost low on non-land, mana producing cards.
- If you have more expensive commander(s)/cards generally, you'll want to add more "ramp" cards that bring up your total mana available in fewer turns.

## Land Base

In this section I'll list more specifics in land types you should include based on how many colors are in your commander's identity. See [This Other Doc and Primer](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/j93VxT5n-0SsTbComv1Ppg) for a list of lands in each type.

# Cutting Cards
Cutting cards down to 100 can be hard. Consider using the "Quadrant Theory."

In which quadrants is the card helpful? If one card is helpful in more quadrants than another, it may be more worth keeping.

- Developing
- Parity
- Ahead / Winning
- Behind / Losing

# Power Level
In social commander gameplay, it is pretty unfun to play against a deck that is extremely strong compared to the other decks at the table. There are a million ways to "grade" decks against each other. This is just my own attempt at an objective approach to determining power levels. With some idea of the power level of decks in mind, players can plan their games to be more balanced.

Start with 0, then add 1 level for each of these types of cards in your deck. The higher the final number, the more powerful the deck is.

- Tutors
- Skip turns
- Cards valued over a certain dollar amount (e.g. $5 for pauper, $20 for commander)
- Infinite combos
- Commander with draw

# Saltiness
Is it worth playing the card if it makes you archenemy out the gate or when you play the card? Maybe?! Depends on what you're after. Either way, these characteristics will cause saltiness in your opponents, regardless of power level. So be ready!

- Cards that generally reduce the ability of a player to enjoy their own deck
- Control a Player for a turn
- Stealing permaments (especially if not until end of turn)
- Forcing others to discard
- Forcing others to mill
- Mass Land destruction

# Scryfall
Use these searches to get a quick peek at each category of cards for your deck. Provided is a sort of manual approach and an approach using Scryfall's tags. Both are provided because sometimes cards are not tagged by the community properly, and you can find more interesting fits/synergies with keyword searches.

NOTE: Add "in:common" to filter for Pauper.
