Wizards of the Coast designs Jumpstart 20-card decks to be thematic, beginner-friendly, and ready to play by combining two packs into a 40-card deck. The typical build approach focuses on simplicity, synergy, and balance within a specific theme (e.g., Pirates, Elves, or Spellcasting). Below is a breakdown of the typical structure and card type distribution for a Jumpstart 20-card pack, based on available information about the original Jumpstart set and its iterations like Jumpstart 2022 and Foundations Jumpstart.[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart-booster/)[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart/)[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/introducing-jumpstart-new-way-play-magic-2020-02-20)

# Typical Build Approach for a Jumpstart 20-Card Deck


## Thematic Cohesion
   - Each pack is built around a specific theme, such as creature types (e.g., Goblins, Angels), mechanics (e.g., Discarding, Spellcasting), or flavorful concepts (e.g., "Well-Read," "Doctor").
   - All cards in the pack align with the theme, either directly (e.g., Pirate creatures for a Pirates theme) or through supporting spells and abilities that enhance the theme's strategy.[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart-booster/)[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/introducing-jumpstart-new-way-play-magic-2020-02-20)
   - Some themes have multiple variations (up to four decklists per theme), with slight differences in card selection to increase replayability and variety. For example, a "Pirates" theme might have different rares or removal spells across its variants.[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/jumpstart-decklists-2020-06-18)[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/card-preview/behind-scenes-designing-jumpstart-2020-06-17)


## Card Count and Type Distribution
 - **Total Cards**: Each Jumpstart pack contains exactly 20 cards, including lands, designed to be combined with another pack to form a 40-card deck.[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart-booster/)[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart/)
 - **Lands (7–8 cards)**:
   - Most packs include 7–8 lands, typically leaning toward 8 for mono-colored decks to ensure consistent mana. This translates to 16 lands in a combined 40-card deck, slightly below the typical 17 for a 40-card Limited deck, but functional due to lower mana curves.[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart-booster/)[](https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/how-to-build-your-own-jumpstart-magic-environment/)
   - Lands usually include:
     - **6–7 Basic Lands** (e.g., Island, Forest) matching the pack’s color.
     - **1 Themed Land**: A special basic land with unique art tied to the pack’s theme (e.g., a Pirates-themed Island or a Predatory-themed Forest).[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart-booster/)[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart/)[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/card-preview/behind-scenes-designing-jumpstart-2020-06-17)
     - In some cases, a **Thriving Land** (e.g., Thriving Isle) is included for mono-colored packs to provide flexibility when paired with another pack of a different color.[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart-booster/)[](https://articles.starcitygames.com/magic-the-gathering/how-to-build-your-own-jumpstart-magic-environment/)
 - **Spells and Creatures (12–13 cards)**:
   - The remaining cards are a mix of creatures, instants, sorceries, enchantments, and artifacts, with a focus on creatures to ensure interactive gameplay.
   - A typical breakdown, inferred from decklists and design insights, is:
     - **Creatures (8–10 cards)**: Creatures are the backbone of most packs, providing board presence and synergy with the theme. For example, a Pirates pack might include cards like Corsair Captain or Spectral Sailor.[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/jumpstart-decklists-2020-06-18)[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart/)
     - **Non-Creature Spells (3–5 cards)**: These include instants, sorceries, enchantments, and artifacts that support the theme or provide interaction (e.g., removal, card draw, or buffs). Examples include Chart a Course for Pirates or Capture Sphere for blue decks.[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/jumpstart-decklists-2020-06-18)[](https://blog.cardkingdom.com/building-decks-with-jumpstart/)
   - The exact ratio depends on the theme. For example:
     - Creature-heavy themes (e.g., Elves, Goblins) may have 10 creatures and 3 non-creature spells.
     - Spell-focused themes (e.g., Spellcasting, Well-Read) may lean toward 6–8 creatures and 5–7 non-creature spells.[](https://blog.cardkingdom.com/building-decks-with-jumpstart/)
 - **Rarity Distribution**:
   - **1–2 Rares**: Every pack includes at least one rare, with one in three packs containing an extra rare (for a total of two). Mythic rare packs (e.g., Chandra or Teferi themes) may have a single, fixed rare or mythic rare.[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart-booster/)[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart/)[](https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/magic-the-gathering-game/feature/mtg-jumpstart-impressions)
   - **Uncommons (3–5 cards)**: Typically, a few uncommons provide additional power or synergy without overwhelming the deck’s simplicity.[](https://samerv.in/blog/mtg-jumpstart)
   - **Commons (6–9 cards)**: Commons fill out the deck, ensuring accessibility and straightforward gameplay.[](https://samerv.in/blog/mtg-jumpstart)
 - **Mana Curve**:
   - Jumpstart packs are designed with a low-to-moderate mana curve to ensure playability, especially for beginners. Most creatures and spells cost 1–4 mana, with a few higher-cost cards (e.g., a 5- or 6-mana rare) to act as finishers.[](https://blog.cardkingdom.com/building-decks-with-jumpstart/)[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/card-preview/behind-scenes-designing-jumpstart-2020-06-17)
   - For example, a Pirates deck might include low-cost creatures like Spectral Sailor (1 mana) and a finisher like Corsair Captain (3 mana), paired with spells like Chart a Course (2 mana).[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/jumpstart-decklists-2020-06-18)


## Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: Packs are designed to minimize complex interactions, making them ideal for new players. Cards are chosen to avoid overly complicated mechanics or decision trees.[](https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/magic-the-gathering-game/feature/mtg-jumpstart-impressions)[](https://samerv.in/blog/mtg-jumpstart)
- **Synergy**: Cards are selected to work well together within the theme. For example, a Spellcasting pack might include creatures that benefit from casting instants and sorceries, like Curious Homunculus, alongside spells like Rain of Revelation.[](https://blog.cardkingdom.com/building-decks-with-jumpstart/)
- **Interaction**: Each pack includes 1–2 removal spells or interactive cards (e.g., Capture Sphere, Finishing Blow) to ensure players can handle opponents’ threats.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/hrn3g2/a_complete_tier_list_of_jumpstart_decklists/)
- **Replayability**: Themes have up to four variants to keep gameplay fresh. For example, the "Predatory" theme has four decklists with different rares or support cards like Neyith of the Dire Hunt or Crushing Canopy.[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/card-preview/behind-scenes-designing-jumpstart-2020-06-17)
- **Power Balance**: Each pack includes at least one “bomb” (a powerful rare or synergistic card) to act as a win condition, balanced by commons and uncommons to maintain fairness in Limited-style play.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/hrn3g2/a_complete_tier_list_of_jumpstart_decklists/)


## Additional Notes
- **Mono-Color Focus**: Most Jumpstart packs are mono-colored to simplify gameplay, though some mythic rare packs (e.g., Rainbow) may include multiple colors. When combined, the resulting 40-card deck is typically two-color, using Thriving lands to smooth mana.[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart-booster/)[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart/)
- **No Foils**: Jumpstart packs do not include foil cards, focusing on gameplay over collectible value.[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart/)
- **New Cards and Reprints**: Packs include a mix of reprints (e.g., Rhystic Study, Craterhoof Behemoth) and new cards (e.g., 37 new cards in the original Jumpstart, 27 new anime-style cards in Foundations Jumpstart) to appeal to both new and veteran players.[](https://draftsim.com/mtg-jumpstart/)[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/foundations-jumpstart-booster-themes)
- **MTG Arena Differences**: On MTG Arena, some cards are replaced due to digital constraints, and the format may use different decklists or mechanics (e.g., Jump In! uses Alchemy cards).[](https://www.thegamer.com/magic-the-gathering-jumpstart-play-guide/)[](https://mtgazone.com/jumpstart-pack-themes-and-contents/)


## Summary of Typical Card Type Counts
- **Lands**: 7–8 (6–7 Basic Lands, 1 Themed Land or Thriving Land)
- **Creatures**: 8–10
- **Non-Creature Spells**: 3–5 (instants, sorceries, enchantments, artifacts)
- **Rares**: 1–2 (one guaranteed, one in three packs has an extra rare)
- **Uncommons**: 3–5
- **Commons**: 6–9

### Design Philosophy in Context
Wizards of the Coast aims for Jumpstart packs to be a “shuffle up and play” experience, requiring minimal deckbuilding knowledge. The low mana curve, thematic synergy, and inclusion of interactive cards ensure that decks are functional and fun, whether paired with a complementary theme (e.g., Elves + Spellcasting) or a chaotic mix (e.g., Cats + Phyrexians). The structure supports both casual play and onboarding new players while offering enough depth for experienced players to enjoy.[](https://www.thegamer.com/magic-the-gathering-jumpstart-play-guide/)[](https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/magic-the-gathering-game/feature/mtg-jumpstart-impressions)[](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/introducing-jumpstart-new-way-play-magic-2020-02-20)
