NOTE: Pretty much have to use Chrome. Firefox haas some minor bugs that are impossible to get around that will drive you nuts.

# Proxy an Existing Card
- Copy the card name
- Navigate to Import / Save'
- Check "Include all unique prints as options"
- Click text box under "Import a real card by name"
    - Paste Card Name
    - Under "Automatically update frame" select a preferred frame type (probably "Borderless (Alt) (Universes Beyond))


# Changing Frame
- Navigate to Frame
- Uncheck "Automatically load Frame Version when loading Frame Packs" - Trust me its annoying when this changes when you're trying to just fix a broken/missing element.
- At the bottom uncheck "Automatically update frame"
- Use the frame dropdowns to find the frames you like. I like:
  - For Legendaries: Showcase Frames > Nickname "Godzilla"
    - Click Load Frame, then add the proper Frame, Crown, Power/Toughness as needed.
    - You'll also want to adjust the Nickname font size so it fits with the mana costs properly.
  - For Non Legendaries: artifacts, Seventh Edition
 
# Adding a Bleed Edge for Printing
- Change the first dropdown to 1/8 Inch Margin
  - Click Load Frame Version (everything should shrink)
- Change the second dropdown, if needed, to the appopriate collection of margins
  - Under "Select a Frame ..." select the appropriate layer
  - Click Add Frame to Card

# Changing Art
- Upload image to imgur.com
- copy the link to the image
- Navigate to Art
- Paste the link in "via URL" text box
- Navigate to Art
- Fix whatever needs adjusted

# Changing Name and Adding the Original Card Name
- Navigate to Text > Title
    - Under "Add a textbox to your card" click Nickname
        - Click newly created "Nickname" tab
            - Change name as needed
- Navigate to Frame
	- Change middle dropdown to "Nicknames"
	- Find the appropriate frame color, then click "Add Frame to Card" button	
- Navigate to Text > Rules Text
	- change any references to the card name if needed

# Changing Flavor Text
- Navigate to Text > Rules Text
	- Find the {flavor} tag or add one to the end. This separates rules text from flavor text.
	- Change the flavor text as needed.
       - Sample: ```{T}: Add {C}{C}.{flavor}“These are you flavor words!”{lns}—This is your author/source!```
